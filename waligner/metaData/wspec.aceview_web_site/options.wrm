  /* wspec/options.wrm
     
     This file is read only at execution time

     It holds the class definitions necessary to the applications.
     The kernel classes are defined in  wspec/sysoptions.wrm
     which can serve as a model when editing this one.

     You can freely edit this file without recompiling
     but it must remain consistent with the other wspec files
     and you must never change the type (A, B, X) of a class
     unless you reconstruct the database from ace files.

     Line starting with _VClassName are parsed, they are expected
     to contain a la Unix a set of -Option parameters.
     Class names must match their enumeration in wspec/classes.wrm
	
     The order in which classes appear here will be used in displays.
	
     Options names can be abbreviated, recognized options are
     -Hidden    : this class will not be listed in the acedb Main Window.
     -Visible   : this class will be listed in the acedb Main Window.
     -Array     : this class is of type A, (Array or tuple).
     -Btree     : this class is of type B, it must be further defined in models.wrm
     -XREF      : Auto cross referencing Hidden B system class. Do not use.
     -Display  displayType : The preferred display type of the class,
		             as enumerated in wspec/disptype.wrm
     -Title  Tag : Tag must be a tag name listed in wspec/tags.wrm (or systags)
	           If present in some object of that class, the text following it
                   will be used preferentially when referring to that object.
     -Symbol Tag : Tag must be a tag name listed in wspec/tags.wrm (or systags)
	           If present in some object of that class, the text
		   or key following it will be used preferentially
                   when referring to that object in Maps.
     -Rename otherName : Other name will show in lists, old and new
                         name will be recognized in ace files and queries, old
                         is used in the code. In case some newName
			 matches some old name, the new name takes precedence.
     -CaseSensitive : The names in this class will be case sensitive.
                      Never undo this option once it has been used.
     -Sybase : Experimental external storage in sybase.
     -Known : Prevents indirect creation of new object in ace files
              You can't enter a new object in this class directly
              but not by quoting it in another object.

     Classes default as -B -H -D TREE
     A classes further default as -H -D ZERO


     Displays:
	Every display type needs a display function.
     Parsers:
        Special code must be provided for A Classes
     Dumps:
        Special code must be provided to dump A classes
     
     These routines must be registered in file wspec/quovadis.h before
     recompilation.
