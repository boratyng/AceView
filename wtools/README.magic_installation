MAGIC is a pipeline to analyse next-generation sequencing
author: mieg@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov

The program has been extensively tested on ILLUMINA hiseq, Lifetech SOLiD and pgm,
Roche-454, Helicos, and should be adaptable to other platforms.

To instal the program, please read the user guide: MAGIC_User_gide.docx

In a nutshell
1) Download the source.tar.gz file
2) Download the (human) target tar.gz file and the test fastq file (human).test.ILM.R[12].fastq.gz
3) Open both the source code and the TARGET tar files
   zcat magic*.tar.gz | tar xvf -
   zcat TARGET.*tar.gz | tar tvf - 
4) To compile on Linux:
    You need the 'gcc' compiler
    You need flex/bison and the X11 run-time libraries Xaw, Xmu...
    The pipeline itself needs 'gawk' 
    Everything else is included in the tar.gz file
          cd magic....
          tcsh
          setenv MAGIC_SRC `pwd`
          setenv ACEDB_MACHINE LINUX
          make -k all

5) To run the test, go back to the top directory and source the test script.
   The test will probably take 2 hours to align 2M 100+100 paired fragments
   on the human genome. If you have access to an SGE cluster with enough nodes
   it would take about the same time to align a much larger data sets.
          cd ..
          source MAGIC_TEST.tcsh

6) To run the code on your own data, look at the user manual.
