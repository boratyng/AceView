freeing data: 

 The rule is that any time you have any AC_* data item, you must
 ac_free it.  When you ac_free it, it becomes immediately invalid
 and all memory dependant on that object also dies.

 This applies to all data types with names beginning AC_ :
	AC_DB
	AC_OBJ
	AC_ITER
	AC_TABLE
	AC_KEYSET

 All of these items MUST be freed by passing them to ac_free

 This does not apply to data types with names beginning ac_ :
	ac_type
	enum ac_tablemaker_where


Objects and lazy loading

 The AC_OBJ is the only object identity exposed in this interface.
 Objects contain data which is lazily loaded.  The minimal object
 content is just a class name and object name.  Touching the data
 inside the object will cause the object data to be loaded.

 Some functions have a fillhint parameter.  If this parameter is true,
 the objects they return will have the data filled already.  From the
 user perspective, it doesn't matter because the lazy loading will
 guarantee that the data is there when you need it, but using fillhint
 can help efficiency.  fillhint=1 reduces the number of transactions
 needed to load the data because the object identity and data come at
 the same time.  fillhint=0 reduces the size of the transaction because
 only the object identity is present in the server response.  For
 small objects, the difference is negligible; for large objects, the
 difference can be substantial.

 fillhint parameters are available on the iterator constructors
 ac_iter_query() and ac_iter_keyset(), and the get-by-name function
 ac_get().  It is not present on other functions that return objects
 because those objects have already been fetched, so it is too late
 to gain an advantage over lazy loading.

 In embeded or stand-alone mode (as opposed to client mode) the
 fillhint parameters is irrelevant since in such a case AceC
 shares the server caches.
